This simple application activates the Fast User Switching feature built-in to Mac OS X. After activating MacLoc in the menu bar, it will appear that you've logged out, however upon entering your username and password, all open documents and applications will be right where you left them. MacLoc is the perfect solution when you need to step away from your computer for a moment.</description>
