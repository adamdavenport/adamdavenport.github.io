      <description>MacLoc is the perfect solution for a busy work environment as well as at home where wandering hands can create a bothersome reduction in productivity. This simple application activates the Fast User Switching feature built-in to Mac OS X. After activating MacLoc in the menu bar, it will appear that you've logged out, however upon entering your username and password, all open documents and applications will be right where you left them. MacLoc is the perfect solution when you need to step away from your computer for a moment.</description>

      <description>Inspired by a futuristic movie trilogy which will remain unnamed as to not infringe upon any copyright issues with those who hold the rights to the films. Let us just say the if we were to use a numerical Matrix combining the directional vectors of a moving object with inertial forces, which may need to be Reloaded into the system, the result would show a graphical analysis of the total Revolutions of the body in motion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compatible with OS X 10.6 or later</description>
